## Tasks and Implementation Details

### Task 0: Physics Objects Setup
**Objective**: Build three objects showcasing distinct physics properties: a bouncy ball, a heavy crate, and a feather.

**Objects**:
- **Bouncy Ball**: Low mass, high bounce for realistic bouncing behavior.
- **Heavy Crate**: High mass, moderate friction for sluggish movement.
- **Delicate Feather**: Very low mass and high drag to simulate gentle fluttering and air resistance.

**Implementation**:
- Set physics materials with specific mass, bounce, and drag properties.
- Tested each object to confirm distinct behaviors in response to gravity and user interaction.

### Task 1: Multi-Point Grabbing System
**Objective**: Implement a two-handed grabbing system for a sword, allowing realistic manipulation of different points on the object.

**Features**:
- **Grab Points**: Hilt, pommel, and blade (for half-swording).
- **Physics Components**: Used FixedJoint and HingeJoint for secure and realistic two-handed control.
- **Constraints**: Limited unrealistic movements, such as excessive bending.

**Implementation**:
- Configured grab points and implemented transitions between one-handed and two-handed grips.
- Downloaded a “hand-and-a-half” sword model for a better VR experience, credited appropriately.

### Task 2: Realistic Object Throwing Mechanics
**Objective**: Design a realistic throwing mechanic using a bowling ball, allowing users to control direction and speed based on force.

**Features**:
- **Weighted Ball**: Set mass and size to reflect a bowling ball's properties.
- **Throw Mechanics**: Calculated throwing force using VR controller velocity on release.

### Task 3: Stacking and Balancing Objects
**Objective**: Create a physics-based balancing game where users stack objects on a beam.

**Setup**:
- **Platform and Beam**: Created a rectangular platform and a cylindrical beam using Unity’s primitives.
- **Objects**: Added spheres, cubes, and cones with different physics properties for variety.

**Feedback**:
- Added sound effects for object placements, wobbles, and crashes.

**Implementation**:
- Configured physics materials for each object and enabled rotational freedom for dynamic stacking.

### Task 4: Force Use
**Objective**: Implement a telekinetic force grab mechanic allowing users to pull objects from a distance.

**Features**:
- **Laser Pointer**: Added a pointer to show the user’s targeting direction.
- **Hover Highlight**: Highlighted objects within selection distance.
- **Force Control**: Increased force based on button hold duration.

**Implementation**:
- Used Unity’s XR Interaction Toolkit for the pointer and object highlight.
- Animated object movement to simulate flying into the user’s hand, enhancing realism.
